What is Hyzx?

Hyzx is an operating system written from scratch with the purporse of learning the inner working of kernel development.

Which features does it have?

None. It can only boot and check if the the next sector is loading correctly.

Which features will it have?

I hope to implement:
*TCP/IP protococol.
*A shell interface.
*GCC so you can code inside the OS.
*A basic GUI.
